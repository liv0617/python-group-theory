# python-group-theory

This is a repo used for some personal projects.

I've made some effort to check it works (e.g. used LLMs to produce test cases that have not terrible coverage) and I know it works for my specific use cases but probably don't assume this without checking further.

Use is also not really documented and probably requires familiarity with group theory!
